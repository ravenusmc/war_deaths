# War Deaths
## Intro

This project will be a project that will allow the user to look at US deaths
in the wars that it fought. I will attempt to use both Pandas and D3.JS to do this
which I think it will be a great way to review some basic D3 concepts. The program
will also have a basic user authentication system that I created with the Mongo DB.

I will also be attempting to work on some web development skills for this project
to get myself ready for the skills USA competition in June of 2017.

Again, I have a background in History and Political Science so this project really
brings together my Humanities background as well as the tech side. Overall, I
believe that it will be a fairly good project.


# Getting started
### Installing
Flask, Python 3.4, Pandas, Mongo DB and Numpy must be installed on your computer

### Technology Stack

1. Flask
2. Python 3.4
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Mongo DB
6. D3.JS
7. React

### Operation

Once the program is downloaded, simply run the program as you would any other python program.
Then follow the address, which your console/terminal tells you to go to see the
website.

# Issues

The D3.JS graphs do not appear to be working on Safari. However, they do come up in
Chrome and FireFox. Also, the comments page also used another separate collection.
I ran into some issues with the users database and comments and by the time I
realized the problem decided just to make a whole other collection.
